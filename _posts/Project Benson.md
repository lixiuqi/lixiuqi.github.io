# Project Benson
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) wants to place street teams at entrances to subway stations to collect email addresses and send free tickets to its annual gala. WTWY wants to use MTA subway data to optimize the placement of street teams, such that they can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to it.

## Approach
Firsly, capture the largest potential audience for Gala signups. Then, focus on the audience most aligned with WomenTechWomenYesâ€™s mission statement.

Leverage MTA subway data to determine high traffic areas: Evaluate subway entries in the morning (6AM - 2PM) and evening exits (2PM - 10PM) to gauge neighborhood activity. Weight the stations by the relative income of the zip code to determine best interested audience. Further refine the data by identifying peak commute times across the weekday to minimize wasted efforts for canvassing.
